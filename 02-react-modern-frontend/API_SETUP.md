# 🌤️ OpenWeatherMap API Setup Guide

Your Weather Dashboard is now connected to the **real OpenWeatherMap API**! ✨💖

## 🔑 Get Your API Key

### Step 1: Sign Up
1. Go to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Click **"Sign Up"** in the top right
3. Create a free account

### Step 2: Get Your API Key
1. After signing up, go to your [API Keys page](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys)
2. You'll see a default API key already generated
3. Copy the API key (it looks like: `a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6`)

### Step 3: Add to Your Project
1. In your project root, create a file called `.env`
2. Add this line (replace with your actual key):
   ```
   VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY=a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6
   ```
3. Save the file

### Step 4: Restart Dev Server
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)

npm run dev
```

**Important:** API keys can take 10-15 minutes to activate after creation!
